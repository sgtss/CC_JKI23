# **Challenge One - Basic algorithms**

**TASK ONE:** 
Provide a test for DAG: Completed

**TASK TWO:** 
Then write the function that returns the depth of a node given the DAG and test it with
your test: Completed 

**TASK THREE:**
You will receive extra points if you name at least two of the three standard algorithms that solve this challenge - or the
other one(s) apart from the algorithm you applied in your solution.

BF: Bellman-Ford, 
D: Dijkstra’s with Fibonacci heaps, 
FW: Floyd-Warshall and 
J: Johnson’s algorithm

**TASK FOUR:**
Alternatively, you can receive extra points if you implement the solution in either Brainfuck or
Assembler , but because you will be considered not totally sane we will not invite you to dinner.
