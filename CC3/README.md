# **Challenge Three - Data visualization and interpretation**

Genetic diversity within species is often structured geographically, reflecting both current ecological and historical drivers of genetic differentiation. Thus population structure, and admixture among populations, should be accounted for when searching for functional diversity within species.

**Provided data:** 
In this link you can find the Q-output and sample metadata of an Admixture (a popular software to infer population structure) analysis, performed on maize and teosinte samples. In the table stored in file “ maize.3.Q ”, each row represents a sample, in the same order as in the also provided “ maize_samples.txt ” metadata file.

**TASK ONE:** 
Considering only the maize samples, plot the Q estimates and the altitude at which each sample was collected. You can make the plot and order the samples however you deem appropriate.

**TASK TWO:**
Besides the code and plot, provide a short biological interpretation (max 50 words) of the admixture analysis and plotted results.
